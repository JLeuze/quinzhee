# Quinzhee
A cool new starter theme for WordCamp sites!

We're still in the planning and design phase, but this repository will be the future home of [a new WordCamp theme](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/07/02/results-from-the-wordcamp-org-tools-follow-up-survey/), code named Quinzhee, which is the most Minnesotan [camping reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee) that I can make. If you have any good ideas for a different, more descriptive name, please share them!

## Theme Features

Right now the primary goal is to identify what features and functionality a good WordCamp theme should have. [Visit this wordpress.org post](http://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/08/26/update-on-building-a-new-wordcamp-theme) to share your ideas for what an awesome new WordCamp theme should have!
